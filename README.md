# Text Statistics Analyzer


A simple JavaScript function to analyze text statistics such as letter count, word count, and sentence count. This project is a part of my initial exploration into Natural Language Processing (NLP).

## About the Project

As a beginner in the field of Natural Language Processing, I wanted to create a simple tool that helps analyze basic statistics of a given text. This project contains a JavaScript function `textStats` that calculates the letter count, word count, and sentence count of a given input text.
